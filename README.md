Calculator for the quicklytes team. Additional features coming soon.

In the dist file, you can find the exe. Run it !

Exe is also found in the front names quicklytes_calculator.exe

Let me know about changes.

Num react 1 is the concentration of the compound in the numerator. 
                                                                          ===> ln([num.reac]/[den.react])
Den react 1 is the concentration of the compounds in the denominator

The small boxes next to the num/den are the powers they are raised to

You probably won't need all four num/den all the time, so enter 1 for both powers and concentrations where you don't need specific values

Any other questions, please message me
